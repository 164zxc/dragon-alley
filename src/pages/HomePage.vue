              A good bookshop is something to treasure and, despite being in the wizarding world, Flourish and Blotts was no different. A dusty treasure trove of literature, it was absolutely
              perfect for any budding wizard hoping to catch up on their reading.

              <br>Quality Quidditch Supplies was Harry Potterâ€™s favourite shop in Diagon Alley. He visited it often when he stayed for three weeks at the Leaky Cauldron, since that summer the new
              Firebolt racing broom had been introduced and the shop had one on display.
